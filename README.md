# ISSS webShell

This repository houses the source code of the official [Information & Systems Security Society website](https://www.isss.io). 

Although the webShell is a static (plain HTML) site, the source code is compartmentalized using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) and built using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). This makes it simple for contributors to update site content, without having to modify a single large HTML file.

## Developer Setup

To make your own build, make sure you have the latest versions of Node.js (4+) and NPM (3+) installed. Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

    npm install
    npm install --global gulp-cli
    
Once you make changes to the files in the `src` directory, build the site by running

    gulp
    
The built/compiled/minified site will be available in the `dist` directory. Open `dist/index.html` to view the site. Because the webShell is a static site, it can be served directly from the filesystem.
